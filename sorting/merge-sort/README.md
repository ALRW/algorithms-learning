Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by:

 - Dividing a list of items into n sublists of one element which are therefore sorted
 - Merges the sublists back together in a sorted list

In almost all cases this algorithm performs with a complexity of O(n log n)
making it efficient to use even on large data structures
